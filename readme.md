# Clock Example

This is my interpretation of the clock example. It is heavily influenced by the CSCI-E15 lecture on the subject.

This was a fun example. To test out the four times of day, I have code to set the time zone to Boston and 3 places on the globe 6 hours from each other - for the live version, I have commented out the other 3.

On a subsequent version, I would have it get the local time where ever the client is located. For now it is hardcoded to Boston (AMERICA EST).
